# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The medical report generation feature allows users to generate structured medical reports from voice conversations between patients and AI medical agents. The current implementation has several issues including unused imports, poor error handling, and potential JSON parsing failures that need to be resolved to ensure reliable report generation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a patient using the medical voice agent, I want the system to generate accurate medical reports from my conversation, so that I have a structured summary of my consultation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to /api/medical-report with valid sessionId, sessionDetail, and messages THEN the system SHALL generate a structured medical report
2. WHEN the OpenAI API returns a valid response THEN the system SHALL parse the JSON content correctly
3. WHEN the report is generated successfully THEN the system SHALL update the database with the report data
4. WHEN the report is saved to database THEN the system SHALL return the generated report as JSON response

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want proper error handling in the medical report API, so that I can diagnose and fix issues when they occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the OpenAI API call fails THEN the system SHALL return a structured error response with appropriate HTTP status code
2. WHEN JSON parsing fails THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message indicating parsing failure
3. WHEN database update fails THEN the system SHALL return an error response with database error details
4. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error details for debugging purposes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working on the codebase, I want clean code without unused imports or variables, so that the code is maintainable and free of warnings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the code is compiled THEN there SHALL be no unused import warnings
2. WHEN the code is compiled THEN there SHALL be no unused variable warnings
3. WHEN database operations complete THEN the result SHALL be properly handled or acknowledged
4. WHEN TypeScript compilation runs THEN there SHALL be no @ts-ignore comments for legitimate type issues

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust JSON parsing for AI-generated content, so that malformed responses don't crash the report generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI response contains markdown code blocks THEN the system SHALL properly strip them before parsing
2. WHEN the AI response has extra whitespace or formatting THEN the system SHALL clean it before JSON parsing
3. WHEN JSON parsing fails THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative parsing strategies
4. WHEN all parsing attempts fail THEN the system SHALL return a meaningful error message to the client
